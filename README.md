Early detection of the pests in plants and crops is a major challenge facing farmers
these days (Gondal & Khan, 2015). The occurrence of insect pests can have significant
negative effects on the quality and quantity of agricultural products such as grains,
vegetables, and fruits. If the pests are not detected in time, there will be an increase in
food insecurity (Faithpraise & Chatwin, 2013). Traditional pest management methods
like trapping, netting, ferreting and using pesticides, are inadequate in addressing the
complexity and variability of pest infestations. These methods can be time-consuming,
labor-intensive, and prone to human error, resulting in late interventions that allow pests
to proliferate (Gondal et al.,2015).
Different strategies have been employed to address the issue of pest management
in agricultural products (Gondal et al.,2015). The rapid development of image
processing technology has provided a new way for pest recognition, which can not only
greatly improve the recognition efficiency, but also solve problems such as lack of
agriculture experts and poor objectivity (Hu et al., 2014). Automatic detection is the
best way which uses image processing techniques for the detection of pests from the
plants and classification algorithms to classify them on the basis of the different
properties of the images (Zhang et al., 2014).
Utilizing machine learning in pest detection is key to improve how pests are
detected. Using image recognition, machine learning algorithms are trained to spot
specific pests or damage. This quick identification helps users make decisions faster and
use the right product to manage pest, like Horticultural Oils and Insecticidal Soaps, a
low toxicity pesticide preventing further damage. Machine learning also ensures pests

are identified correctly, even when they look similar, reducing the chance of using the
wrong pesticide that could harm the plants or environment, like chlorpyrifos,
neonicotinoids, and glyphosate. In a study published by El-Din and Ismail (2021), the
researchers found that targeted pest management practices, supported by advanced
detection methods, lead to reduced chemical applications, minimizing environmental
impact and fostering sustainable agricultural practices. This is particularly important in
addressing the growing concerns about pesticide resistance and environmental
degradation.
By supporting sustainable farming practices, it reduces reliance on harmful
chemicals and minimizes environmental impact, contributing to healthier ecosystems.
Ultimately, pest detection application leads to improved crop health, higher yields, and
more effective pest management, making it the best approach to managing pests while
protecting both crops and the environment.
